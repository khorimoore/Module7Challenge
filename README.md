# Module 7 README.md Generator Challenge
  
  ## Description
  This assignment involves creating a node.js application that dynamically generates a `README.md` file based on user input. The user is prompted with a series of questions, and the application formats the responses into a structured `README.md` file.

  ## Installation
  1.Clone GitHub repo: 'git clone<url>' 

  2.Navigate into your project directory 

  3.Install required dependencies using 'npm'-'npm install'

  ## Usage
  Once installed run the CLI to generate the README.md file. When in the CLI run 'node index.js' to start the generator.

   4.Open a pull request for review

  ## Tests
  No formal tests are included, but you can easily test the overall functionality of the program by simply running it multiple times with different inputs. Generally this will test how the README.md file changes and reacts to said changes.
